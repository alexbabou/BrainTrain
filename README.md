# BrainTrain
Brain training project that allows you to practice making logical decisions use rock, paper, scissors. Very basic to practice Swift.

## How it works:
The app will make a move (rock, paper, or scissors) and will tell you to either win or lose.
If you choose the correct option based on the app's insturctions, you get a point, otherwise you lose a point.
